He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software.', 'We‚Äôre pretty close to the manufacturing size limit for a milled copper &amp; steel jacket nozzle. Lot of complexity to add a nozzle extension to a sea level engine for small gain.

It‚Äôs just lossy &amp; very slow (especially output)', 'Above 50% likely to make it', 'This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal.', 'Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.', 'The first Raptor Vacuum engine (RVac) for Starship has shipped from SpaceX‚Äôs rocket factory in Hawthorne, California to our dev‚Ä¶', 'Yes', 'Chart understates lithium-ion potential by roughly 1/3', 'Model 3 rated as most reliable car', 'Turns out you can make anything fly haha', 'Exactly. This is not fully appreciated.', 'Starship SN6 flew asimilar hop to SN5, but it was a much smoother &amp; faster operation', 'üá©üá™üñ§Giga Berlin Mannschaftüñ§üá©üá™ Vielen Dank f√ºr Ihre hervorragende Arbeit an Giga Berlin!!', 'Great trip to Germany.

It‚Äôs when you hang out there that problems arise.', 'The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC &amp; differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.', 'Videodrome', 'Sorry, sir I think I have momentinertiaphobia', 'Falcon 9 first stage lands at Landing Zone 1 to complete this booster‚Äôs fourth flight', 'Yeah', 'LHC tbh', 'If you ever want to build a long accelerator tunnel, straight or circular, I know some people ‚Ä¶', 'After launching SAOCOM 1B and two rideshare payloads to orbit, Falcon 9‚Äôs first stage returns to Earth and lands at Landing Zon‚Ä¶', 'Deployment of SAOCOM 1B confirmed', 'Falcon 9‚Äôs first stage has landed at Landing Zone 1', 'Liftoff!', 'Cool', 'Snout Boops', 'Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation', 'If some company has solved a useful thing that we can just buy, that would be great! It‚Äôs so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to.', 'Tesla Germany designed &amp; built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too', 'Technically, James Watt measured a pony, added 50% &amp; rounded up haha', 'Also, Critical Thinking', 'Alexander and the Rise of Hellenism and Film Studies', 'Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind.', 'Yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff.', 'It‚Äôs too embarrassing', 'Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab &amp; still has some of my old homework ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard.', 'People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone.
